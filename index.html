      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>Python is a high-level programming language that was created by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s. The language priorities readability and simplicity. It is and can be used for several purposes such as desktop application, mobile application, machine learning and games. </p>

      <p>This is good languages for anyone who wants to learn programming and does not come from a programming background. According to many programmers, it is the easiest to learn. Python takes less lines of code which would take many lines in other programming languages. Following is an example of printing something to screen using java and python.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Python
          <code class="code">
              &nbsp;public class Main {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello World");<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
              &nbsp;}<br>
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Java
          <code class="code">print("Hello World")</code>
        </li>

      <header><h2>Installing</h2></header>

      <p>Unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, python programs cannot be executed out of the box. Some programs need to be installed before executing a python program. To be specific, python interpreter needs to be installed. It can be downloaded from the python website. Installing the latest version is preferable. </p>

      <p>In order to write the python programs a code editor is needed. It can be anything from the notepad that comes with the operating system (Windows or Mac) or a text editor that is specifically designed for programming such as Visual Studio Code. Python interpreter also comes with a code editor. Additionally, there is python shell in which python commands or code can be tested. The shell also comes with the interpreter, and it can be useful tool when learning to program as a beginner. Following are some examples of code editors. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Atom</li>
        <li>Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Brackets</li>
        <li>Vim</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Executing Python Programs</h3>

      <p>Before writing python programs, let’s learn how to run python programs. The program can be run in any Command Line Interface (CLI) tool such as windows command prompt. </p>

      <p>First the folder where the python code file should be located in the CLI. The commands for navigating different CLIs will be in the internet. However, following are the basic commands for windows command prompt. </p>

      <h3>Saving Python Programs</h3>

      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Listing all files in the directory.
          <code class="cmd">dir</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Opening a folder.
          <code class="cmd">cd pathToFolder</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Going back one directory level.
          <code class="cmd">cd ..</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header><h2>Variables</h2></header>

      <p>A variable is a data that is stored under a name which can later be manipulate using its given name. Following code explains how to define a variable</p>

      <code class="code">
        name = "John Doe"
      </code> 
      
      <p>‘name’ is the variable name and ‘John Doe’ is the data or value assigned to it.</p> 
      
      <p>The equal sign (=) is called assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.</p>

      <p>Following are some rules for naming variables.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Variable names can only contain letters, numbers and underscore.</li>
        <li>Names cannot start with a number.</li>
        <li>Reserve words such as ‘print’ cannot be used.</li>
        <li>Variable names are case sensitive</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="data">
      <header><h2>Data</h2></header>

      <p>There are many different types of data are built into python and other programming languages. However, this documentation covers only 3 of the following.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Integer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Integer refers to positive and negative whole numbers. They have no decimals and no limit to their length.</li>

            <li>Ex: -5, 0, 3</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>          
          <h3>Float</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Float numbers contain decimal points, and they can be positive or negative.</li>
            <li>Ex: -2.3, 8.3</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>          
          <h3>String</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It is a text within single or double quotes. </li>
            <li>Ex: “Hello World”, “45”, ‘John’.</li>
            <li>String has several built-in functions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
